# Bible Challenge

## Problems:
[] The api doesn't work with the current api I'm using. I need to self host something to serve the translation I want (that is not open source it seems)
- Try this one: https://github.com/rkeplin/bible-go-api
- Or make my own, see how to use the bible xml to do it.
- Find how other projects have good translations to use.
